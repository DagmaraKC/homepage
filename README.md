## Demo
https://dagmarakc.github.io/homepage/

This is my first website created during the YouCode course. Still evolving with my skills and knowledge

## Technology used:
- HTML
- CSS (BEM convention)
- JavaScript
- Normalize

## Function

There is a button here that changes the theme of the page to dark (page background and font) for easier reception in the evening.
The same button changes its content depending on the enabled theme.
